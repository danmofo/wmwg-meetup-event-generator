See the [associated blog post](https://www.dmoffat.com/writing/2024/07/building-a-tool-to-reduce-repetitive-work) to see what this is.

## Requirements

This project requires Deno to be installed - you can install it by [folllowing the instructions here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation/)

I used Deno so I could write TypeScript directly without a compilation step.

## Running

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-write main.ts
```
