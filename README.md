See the [associated blog post](https://www.dmoffat.com/writing/2024/07/building-a-tool-to-reduce-repetitive-work) to see what this is and how I built it.

## Requirements

This project requires Deno to be installed - you can install it by [folllowing the instructions here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation/)

I used Deno so I could write TypeScript directly without a compilation step.

## Running

```bash
./generate-event-templates
```

Then visit the URL printed to your terminal in the browser to view the event templates.
